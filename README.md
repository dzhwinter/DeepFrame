# DeepFrame
===========
learning from outstanding frameworks

DeepFrame is an benchmark of open source deep learning framework. gathering some tips from their project and join in DeepFrame
These DeepFramework include:

TODO 

- Caffe: is famous deeplearning and have a lot users
- Caffe2:  yangqing improve his caffe.
- lasso and pylearn2:  python abstract. it is the most easy one to modify
- torch:  just want to review lua script. do not want to add torch nnnet into DeepFrame, just I like lua
- mxnnet: cxxnet and minerva combination, cxxnet implement based on mshadow abstraction, minerva give an example use DAG schedule, stream engine  need to explore

## Lasso and pylearn2
some tips from their jobs.

Google similar framework tensorFLow has been opened source two weeks ago. TensorFlow is a DeepLearning&MacnineLearning Framework build on abstract of Big Operation, small Operation, its programming model is similar with Caffe2(Thanks YangQing's Guide opensource framework) and Mxnet(Big Operation too)  which is similar to, DeepFrame would corrdinate with the big brother tensorflow.

What is an Big Operation?
In my Opinion, 

learning the mxnet design engine.
mxnet support 

I think good allocator will make contribute to tensorFLow.
take a look at leveldb memory model, mxnet model.
